Metropolian Leppävaaran Opiskelijat – LEPO ry
</p>
<p>LEPO is a local student union operating in the Leppävaara unit of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.</p>
<p>
LEPO is a subdivision of the actual student organization METKA and represents METKA’s actions in Leppävaara.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
At the time of writing, there are nearly fifteen hundred students in Leppävaara. Someone’s got to do it!</p>
<p>Our main tasks are to lobby, to act as a politically active component in Leppävaara and to relay information from METKA and other student unions elsewhere down to our fellow students in Leppävaara.
</p>
<p>
To the normal student this appears as taking care of selling tickets to various events, selling the student card stickers/stamps,
organizing events,acting as a bridge between students and the staff of Leppävaara and whatever issue needs taking care of.</p>

<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>
Everyone working for and with LEPO are volunteers and fellow students with an open mindset.<br>
We don’t pay ourselves for doing this, but we feel that being able to do all these things we can do is a reward enough in itself.<br>
Anybody is welcome to help us improve the study and social experiences for students in Leppävaara!<br>
